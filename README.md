# backward-text

A website with a textbox where the user needs to enter some text, for eg: a name, fruits name or any text for that matter and when they tap the "Reverse" button the text reverses.

# Examples

- **Apple** to **elppa**
- **Pear** to **raep**
- **Banana** to **ananab**
- **pseudopodia** to **aidopoduesp**

# Why?

I needed a website to reverse text, instead of reversing text manually for long words (as that would just waste time), I couldn't find anything like this so I made the reverse text website/software.
